# HarvestHero

HarvestHero is a machine learning model designed to predict the optimal crop to be grown in a given area based on various environmental factors and historical data.

## Features

- **Predictive Analysis:** HarvestHero leverages historical data and machine learning algorithms to predict the most suitable crop for a specific location.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive interface makes it easy for farmers to input their location and access crop recommendations.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Users can adjust various parameters such as soil type, climate conditions, and market demand to tailor recommendations to their specific needs.
- **Scalability:** HarvestHero is designed to scale with large datasets, ensuring accurate predictions even in regions with diverse agricultural characteristics.

## How it Works

HarvestHero utilizes a combination of supervised learning techniques, including regression and classification algorithms, to analyze input data and predict the most suitable crop. The model takes into account factors such as:

- Climate conditions (temperature, precipitation, humidity)
- Soil type and quality
- Previous crop rotations
- Market demand and profitability
